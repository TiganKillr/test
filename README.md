# AMC Robot
---
Welcome to my page about the **Arm Manipulated Camera** Robot (AMC).

This is my first robotics project thats deals with electromechanical systems and software.

What is it?
---
The AMC is a robot arm designed to be used in video recording / photography.

In the future, the end effector will become swappable with other tools.

With 5 DOF and a total length of 40cm, I will be able to use it sufficiently.
