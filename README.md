## AMC Robot

Welcome to my page about the **Arm Manipulated Camera** Robot (AMC).

This is my first robotics project thats deals with electromechanical systems and software.

&nbsp;
## What is it?

The AMC is a robot arm designed to be used in video recording / photography.

In the future, the end effector will become swappable with other tools and provide other uses.
